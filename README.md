# 100 Days of coding complete python bootcamp

## Day1: Variables
Inputs and printing, not much to say, straightforward naming and simple printing.

## Day2: Data types and manipulating Strings
Simple math and strings, fstring add variables as a {x} easy imput for variables, ** used for pot calc and // for ecludian div, as well as python following PEDMAS.
round() and type casting is used for specific scenarios, str() to convert to string, and int()
Code is a simple bill calculator with tip and equal part division. 

## Day3: Control Flow and Logical Operators
">" greater than, and ">=" greater or equal, use == and != for equal and not equal. Reminder of modulo division (residual of euclidian division) "%".
Using if and elif, second conditionals with nested if statements.
Logical operators, and or not (&& || !)
treasure island, is a basic input game controlled by if statements and some art.

## Day4: Randomisation and Python Lists

### Modules 
Importing [random module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html) to use random functions.
Modules are used to separate different specific functions or packages of fucntions to be used by others, random is one created by the Python team.
Creating personal modules are imported and used as any other, with import function and calling variables or functions with the name pf the module and the item to use.

### Lists
[Lists](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html) are powerful datasets in python, being able to view specific items, add modify and substract on different positions. A list is stored in the specific order it is created.
Lists can be nested to create more complex structures.

## Day5: Python Loops
Use of for loop in python, general usage, "for in"  goes thru items in a list or numbers in a range, for numbered iterations.

A Random password generator asking for n of letter, symbols and numbers, then randomizing between selected random of each.

## Day6: Funtions and Karel

### while loop
This kind of loop is not defined to stop unless a scenario is met, during the loop definition this condition should considered.

### Funtions
In python, to define a new function, def is used to announce said definition.
Defining funtions does not make the be executed, as usual thi is used to define specific scenario functions and calling them for the requiered specific use.
[Using Reeborgs World](https://reeborg.ca/reeborg.html?lang=en&mode=python&menu=worlds%2Fmenus%2Freeborg_intro_en.json&name=Hurdle%201&url=worlds%2Ftutorial_en%2Fhurdle1.json), to show use case of loops and function definitions.

## Day7: Hangman

Starting all projects with a flowchart to properly review the steps requiered is essential to keeping a proper order and a clear goal.

This project reviews previously learned items, except functions, strings, importing loops and validations in lists.

The lists are very useful to access positions and replace positions on a streing, they can be joined to be printed as a single line on console.

## Day8: Function Parameters and Caesar Cipher

Defining functions, parameters are used to create variables that can affect within the function. Parameters are variables that are used to call the function for even more specific cases.

The Ceasar Cipher takes letters from the alphabet and shifts them by a specific amount, in order to encode or decode a message. Shifts here can be done in both senses, to decode. Symbols and other inputs are passed from one to the other, only items from the alphabet, but this could be easily modified to specific characters, making the coding even harder to decode.
